1.DSA stands for Data Structure & Algorithm.
2.Data Structure:
    a.Data Structure is used to Structure your data in a certain way.
    b.Data Structure is like different ways to store and organize data so that we can easily find them and perform operations quickly.
    c.example: Think of a list of your favorite books. You can organize them in different ways. Alphabetically, by genre or by the date of you read them. Each of these arrangements are different data structure.
    d.Another example: 
        1.Suppose, you have a telephone diary and you want to search phone number for "Suraj" and the records are arranged in random order. 
        2.So, we have to check every record in the diary and it will take longer much time to find.
        3.But, imagine that if the record is arranged in alphabetical order then it become easy to find the data.
        4.You just just to the  first letter of the name like "S" and then "U" and  within a minute you will find the phone number.
        5.So, that's why structuring data is important. It takes less time to find the data.
    e.Types of Data Structure:
        1.Linear Data Structure:
            a.In linear data structure, data is arranged in a linear or sequential order.
            b.Ex: Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks and Queues.
            c.Linear struture traversed in a single, straight lind, visiting each element one by one.
            d.It is easy to understand and utilize memory efficiently.
            e.Insertion and deletion at arbitrary poisition is inefficiently. 
        2.Non-linear Data Structure:
            a.In non linear structure, data is not arranged in a linear or sequential order. It create more complex relationships.
            b.Ex: Graphs, Tree.

3.Algorithm:
    a.Algorithm is used to perform the best approach so that the operation should take less time.
    b.If we take the above example, We have to perform the algorithm to find the phone number in the best way.
    c.The correct algorithm is, first it will search for first letter "S" and then "U" and after that you will find the name "Suraj"
